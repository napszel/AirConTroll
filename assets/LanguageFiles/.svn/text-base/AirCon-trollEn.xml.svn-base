		The size of the award you get on each level is based on 2 things: the number of pipes you built in your route (the more pipes the bigger award) and the number of moves you made (the more moves the smaller award). 
		+++ The 'built in pipes' component of you award:
		You get a certain amount of points for each pipe that is built in your route (colored) when you finish the level. The points are as follows:
		
		
		Each bonus pipe is worth twice as many points as if it was a regular one.
		--- The 'number of moves' component of your award:
		You won't lose any points for rotating pipes but you will lose for switching them. This component of your award starts at 1000 points, but falls by 50 points for each pair of pipes you switch. When you are over 17 switches, you lose 5 points for each subsequent switch.
